description: Downloads and summarizes audio/video media — podcasts, YouTube videos, talks, interviews, lectures, and conference presentations. Saves a structured markdown summary locally, publishes it as a public GitHub Gist, and opens it in the system default application. Use when the user provides a URL to any audio or video content (Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, conference recordings, etc).

The user has provided a media URL: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps exactly:

## Step 0 — Bootstrap dependencies

Run the bootstrap script (`scripts/bootstrap.sh` relative to this skill's directory). It installs missing tools, verifies `gh` is authenticated, and skips subsequent runs via a marker file.

```bash
bash "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/bootstrap.sh"
```

If it exits non-zero, stop and tell the user what to fix before continuing.

## Step 1 — Resolve a YouTube URL

If the URL is already a YouTube URL (`youtube.com` or `youtu.be`), use it directly.

Otherwise (Apple Podcasts, Spotify, conference sites, etc.), extract the title from the page, then search YouTube for the matching video/episode. Use `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__fetch_content` or `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__brave_web_search` to find it.

## Step 2 — Download the transcript with yt-dlp

Run:

```bash
yt-dlp --write-auto-sub --sub-lang en --skip-download --sub-format vtt -o "/tmp/media_transcript" "<YOUTUBE_URL>"
```

This produces `/tmp/media_transcript.en.vtt`. (The raw transcript stays in `/tmp/` — only the final summary goes to `~/Downloads/`.)

## Step 3 — Parse the VTT into clean timestamped lines

Run the VTT parser script (`scripts/parse_vtt.py` relative to this skill's directory). It deduplicates overlapping caption windows and preserves timestamps for deep-linking:

```bash
python3 "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/parse_vtt.py"
```

Output format — one line per segment:
```
[00:00:00] I'm doing something absolutely insane right now.
[00:00:04] Artificial intelligence is a little bit perplexing
```

## Step 4 — Read the transcript in chunks, then generate the summary

### 4a — Check size and read in batches

First check how many lines the transcript has:

```bash
wc -l /tmp/media_clean_transcript.txt
```

Then use the **Read tool** (not Bash) to read the file in batches of **400 lines** using `offset` and `limit`. For a 1000-line file, make three Read calls: offset=1/limit=400, offset=401/limit=400, offset=801/limit=400. Read all batches before writing anything.

### 4b — Write the summary

After reading all batches, write a comprehensive, well-structured markdown summary covering:

- **Speaker/guest background** and why they were invited or why this talk matters
- **Core thesis / main argument**
- **All major topics discussed** with concrete details, examples, frameworks, and notable quotes
- **Key takeaways and actionable insights**
- **Books, tools, or resources mentioned**
- **One-sentence bottom line**

Use `##` section headers, bullet points, and bold text for scannability. Aim for 800–1200 words of substance.

**Timestamps:** For each major topic or section in the summary, include a YouTube deep-link using the timestamp from the transcript. Convert `[HH:MM:SS]` to total seconds for the `?t=` parameter (e.g. `[01:05:30]` → 3930 seconds). Format as a linked timestamp at the start of the relevant bullet or subheading:

```markdown
### [[01:05:30]](https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID?t=3930) Power Concentration
```

or inline for bullets:

```markdown
- **[[00:14:00]](https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID?t=840) Epistemic collapse** — We are entering...
```

Use the YouTube URL from Step 1 as the base. Include timestamps for every major topic/section — aim for one timestamp per significant topic shift.

## Step 5 — Write the markdown file

Derive a slug from the title using **only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens** — strip all other characters (spaces become hyphens, consecutive hyphens collapse to one, leading/trailing hyphens removed). This sanitization is critical: shell metacharacters in the slug (`;`, `$()`, backticks, quotes) would be injected into file paths and `gh` commands below. Example: `jenny-wen-design-process`. Save the summary to:

```
~/Downloads/<slug>_summary.md
```

Follow the template at `references/media-summary-template.md.j2` (relative to this skill's directory). Key points:

- The metadata fields (Guest, Hosts, Podcast, Published) **must be a bullet list**, not bare lines — bare consecutive lines collapse into a single paragraph in CommonMark.
- **No horizontal rules (`---`) between sections.** Use only one, directly before the italicised source attribution at the bottom.
- Key Takeaways is the first section, before Guest Background.
- `gist_url` starts as `(to be filled after publishing)` and is updated in Step 6.
- The source link at the bottom **prefers YouTube or PocketCasts over Apple Podcasts**. If you already have a YouTube URL from Step 1, use that. Otherwise check for a PocketCasts link (`pca.st` or `pocketcasts.com`). Fall back to the original URL only if neither is available.

## Step 6 — Publish as a public GitHub Gist

Create a public GitHub Gist with the summary content. The gist filename must be prefixed with `summary-`, e.g. `summary-jenny-wen-design-process.md`.

Use the `gh` CLI:

```bash
gh gist create --public --filename "summary-<slug>.md" --desc "<Title> — Media Summary" "$HOME/Downloads/<slug>_summary.md"
```

All arguments containing the slug or title **must be double-quoted** to prevent word-splitting and globbing. The `--desc` value is particularly important since the title may contain special characters even after slug sanitization (the description uses the original title, not the slug).

Once you have the Gist URL, update the `gist_url` field in the frontmatter of `~/Downloads/<slug>_summary.md`, then run:

```bash
gh gist edit <gist-id> "$HOME/Downloads/<slug>_summary.md"
```

so the published Gist also contains the self-referencing URL.

Print the resulting Gist URL to the user.

## Step 7 — Open the file and notify

Open the summary in the background (so it doesn't steal focus) and post a macOS notification:

```bash
open -g "$HOME/Downloads/<slug>_summary.md" 2>/dev/null || xdg-open "$HOME/Downloads/<slug>_summary.md" 2>/dev/null || true
```

```bash
osascript -e 'display notification "Summary saved and Gist published" with title "Media Summary"' 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Final output to user

Tell the user:
- The local file path
- The public Gist URL
- A one-paragraph teaser of what the content is about
